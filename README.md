# XnorDuinoDesktop
XnorDuinoDesktop is an hardware automation GUI, build for XnorBus based I2C communication devices.
---

## Goals
XnorDuinoDesktop includes:

1. **Modularity and expandability:**

   It's easy to add additional hardware modules to the GUI, to quick and easly build large sensor-networks. 

2. **Ease of use**

   The system is easy to use and compatible with many Arduino programmed devices.

3. **XnorBus compatible:**

   Large portions of the communication between hardware is handled within the XnorBus libraries. 

4. **XnorBee compatible**

   Wireless Zigbee communication is implemented using Digi XBee modules.
   Large portions of wireless communication is handled within the XnorBee libraries.
